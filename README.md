# Syllabasics

An important part of student life is being organized. Organizing all the classes and respective syllabi can be difficult. A syllabus contains important information pertaining to the class that the student must know to do well. Normally, students have to manually traverse through each individual syllabus, highlight important information, then record the information which can be tedious and time consuming. 
With Syllabasics, this process can take a fraction of the time. Syllabasics can download the student’s class syllabi from the school class database, go through each syllabus, find key information (such as key dates, required textbooks, and important contact information), and record it into files and calendars for the student. 
Syllabasics will also be able to interface with Amazon, Google Calendar, and RateMyProfessors.com. Amazon will display purchasing options for textbooks. Google Calendar will display important dates (Tests and Quizzes) on the student’s Google Calendar account. RateMyProfessors.com will provide information, such as rating from the website, relating to the professor of each class. 
The class information, such as class location, grading criteria, and teacher info, such as professor office location, and office hours, will then be compiled and stored to an easy to access and easy to read file. Making organization basic with Syllabasics.
